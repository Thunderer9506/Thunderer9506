## 🔭 About me
I like building things that solve a problem — from tiny automation scripts to deployable web apps. I focus on Python backends, APIs, and data-driven utilities, but I enjoy front-end polish when a project needs it. I learn fast and I care about readable code, clear READMEs, and reproducible demos.

## 🧰 Tech & tools
Python • Flask • FastAPI • Node.js • Express • React (Vite) • MongoDB • PostgreSQL • SQLAlchemy • NumPy • pandas • Matplotlib • Git • Docker (basics)

---

## 🔧 What I build
- **Automation & utilities** — scripts that save time (data pulls, Spotify playlist generators, small CLIs).  
- **Backend services & APIs** — auth, CRUD, integrations with public APIs.  
- **Full-stack demos** — minimal frontend + production-ready backend to show end-to-end flow.  
- **Learning projects** — focused experiments to learn a new library or pattern, then polished into a small product.

## ⭐ Featured projects
> Click the repo names (or replace with links) — each has a short demo and setup in the README.

- **Spotify_Top_100_Music_Billboard** — generate a Spotify playlist for any historical date (Python + Spotify API + automation).  
- **Python_Blog** — a simple deployable blog platform (Flask, auth, CRUD, SQL).  
- **Personal-Finance-App** — a compact finance tracker / UI demo (JS + lightweight backend).  
- **ISS_Viewer / Rain_alert** — small API-driven utilities that show practical use of public APIs.  
- **Portfolio (website)** — hosted front-end to showcase projects and demos (GitHub Pages / Vite).

## 📂 How to explore my repos (quick guide)
1. Look at **Pinned** repos first — they are the most polished and demo-ready.  
2. Open the `README.md` in a project for: one-line summary → demo GIF/screenshot → quick setup (3 commands).  
3. Check issues and recent commits to understand activity and code style.

---

## 📝 What I care about in a repo
- Clear README with demo and setup.  
- Small, focused commits with meaningful messages.  
- A working demo (even a GitHub Pages or short GIF) — shows the project is alive.  
- Tests or at least a quick “how I tested it” note.

---

## 📈 GitHub stats & badges (optional)
You can add dynamic badges / stats images (e.g., top languages, contribution graph, streak) if you want a livelier profile. I can add those automatically.

## ⚡ Quick wins I can do for your profile (pick any)
- Turn this into a personalized README with direct repo links and screenshots/GIFs.  
- Create polished README for **one** repo (I recommend `Spotify_Top_100_Music_Billboard` or `Python_Blog`).  
- Add GitHub Actions YAML (CI) and a badge for one repo.  
- Generate a small demo GIF checklist (how to capture, crop, and embed).

If you want this final version with real repo links, images, and a couple of badges (and maybe a short intro GIF), tell me:
1. Which **3 projects** should I feature (exact repo names — I can fetch links if you want).  
2. Do you want a **casual** vibe or **professional** tone?  
3. Which email (or say “don’t include email”)?  
4. Want dynamic GitHub stats badges included? (yes/no)

I’ll generate the final README with exact links and optional badges/screenshots after you answer — or I can just auto-fill using the repos I already saw.
